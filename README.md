# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction

A machine learning project using **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor** to predict restaurant ratings based on features like cuisine, location, cost, and more.

---

## 📊 Objective

Predict the **Aggregate Rating** of restaurants using various features such as cuisine, location, average cost, and service types. The project applies both **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regression** models to analyze and forecast ratings.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `Dataset.csv`
- Includes both **numerical** and **categorical** data
- Example features:
  - Restaurant Name
  - Location
  - Average Cost for Two
  - Online Order
  - Table Booking
  - Cuisines
  - Aggregate Rating

> ⚠️ Make sure the dataset file is placed correctly in your working directory or update the path in the code.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas` – Data handling
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Visualization
  - `Scikit-learn` – Machine learning

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train:
   - 🔹 Linear Regression
   - 🔹 Decision Tree Regressor
6. Evaluate using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
7. Visualize:
   - Feature importance from Decision Tree
   - Actual vs Predicted (Linear Regression)

---

## 📈 Visuals

### 🔹 Feature Importance (Decision Tree)
Shows which features have the most influence on the prediction.

### 🔹 Linear Regression Plot
Actual vs. Predicted Aggregate Ratings for model evaluation.

## ✅ Model Evaluation

### Linear Regression
- **Mean Squared Error**: _e.g.,_ `0.328`
- **R² Score**: _e.g.,_ `0.68`

### Decision Tree Regressor
- **Mean Squared Error**: _e.g.,_ `0.276`
- **R² Score**: _e.g.,_ `0.74`

---

## 🧪 Sample Output



Linear Regression Performance:
Mean Squared Error: 0.328
R-squared: 0.68

Decision Tree Regression Performance:
Mean Squared Error: 0.276
R-squared: 0.74


## 🚀 How to Run
````

1. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
````

2. Run the script:

```bash
python restaurant_rating_prediction.py
```

> Replace the filename if using Jupyter or Colab accordingly.
